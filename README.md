# Birthday Harbinger

Birthday Harbinger is a birthday reminder app developed with SwiftUI, designed to make remembering birthdays easy and enjoyable.

## Features

- **Add Contacts with Details**  
  Add individuals with their **photo**, **name**, **birthdate**, and **category** (Family, Friends, or Other). 

- **Organized by Category**  
  The main screen displays contacts organized by category, making it easy to navigate and view birthdays.

- **Pin or Delete Contacts**  
  Pin important contacts to the top of the list or delete them if they’re no longer needed.

  Use the Settings screen to adjust the **app theme** (Light or Dark mode) and **language** (English or Turkish).

- **Custom Notifications**  
  Never miss a birthday again! Choose to receive reminders:
  - **Up to 1 week in advance** – set your preferred notification day and time.
  - **On the exact day** of the birthday, to ensure you’re always prepared.
